Homework 1 due before live session 2. 

QUIZS ARE NOT QUIZS!
HW start are pretty straight forward, then become complicated
Start groups now to help with homework questions.
In order importance learn and grade
1.  Async and each other! 
2.  Swirl
3. Online resources!
4. Me
5. You have a grader, they are a useful resource as well.

Homeworks can take 8 HOURS?!?! 
Homeworks slightly ambiguous, slight confusing!
Formatting homework to be easy to view. 
SHOW ME THE OUTPUT OF YOUR CODE IN YOUR HOMEWORK.

Three goals:
Survive homework  (Async  and class will support you here)
Gain experience doing presentations ( Group support )
Identify what you uniquely need to succeed ( Your insight and my support)
