# Code Book for Live Session Unit 06 (Assignment 5)
This repo describes all objects and files used for the Assignment 5 Homework.

## Summary
Our client is expecting a baby soon. However, he is not sure what to name the child. Being out of the loop, he hires us to help him figure out popular names. He provides for you the raw data for 2015 and 2016 in order to help us make a decision.


### Files
There are 2 files provided in raw format that we will use, various objects in R that we will use to transmute the data and finally write the results to a simply CSV file.

	* yob2016.txt: Popular names of children in 2015
